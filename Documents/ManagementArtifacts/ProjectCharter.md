## Project Overview

### Project Overview

This project consist into making a serious game about climate change. The learning aspect of the game must be visible and efficient.

### Project Objectives

This project aims to developp a Serious game that will:

- Allow the player to move a character on the screen in four directions.
- Display a map on the screen .
- Allow the player to do specifics actions.

## Constraints

Here are the constraints of the project:

- The project must be completed by 12/13/2024.
- The project must be developed using Godot engine.

## Risks

Here are the risks of the project:

| **Risk Category**       | **Risk**                    | **Likelihood** | **Impact** | **Description**                                                                                  | **Mitigation**                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Technical Risks**     | godotscript          | High           | High       | Verilog is difficult to work with for complex game logic, potentially causing delays and errors. | Conduct early research, break tasks into smaller parts, and allocate time for debugging.           |
| **Timeline Risks**      | Deadline Overrun            | High           | High       | Tight deadline of 12/13/2024 might be missed due to unforeseen delays.                           | Break tasks into smaller milestones, monitor progress regularly, and avoid feature creep.          |
| **Resource Risks**      | Team Skill Gaps             | Medium         | Medium     | Uneven team experience with Verilog or FPGA could slow down progress.                            | Assign tasks based on skills, conduct internal workshops, and encourage knowledge sharing.         |
|  **Human risk**             | Team Availability           | Low            | High       | Unexpected team member absences may create bottlenecks in the development process.               | Delegate tasks effectively and consider overlapping responsibilities to ensure project continuity. |
| **Project Scope Risks** | Feature Creep               | Medium         | Medium     | Adding more features (levels, effects) could lead to an increased workload and delays.           | Stick to the predefined scope and evaluate feature requests based on feasibility and time limits.  |
| **External Risks**      | Third-Party Dependencies    | Low            | Medium     | Stakeholder (ALGOSUP) might request changes that add complexity or increase the workload.        | Maintain clear communication and document any scope changes with agreement from the team.          |

## Conclusion

This projects aim to deliver a serious game able to make peoples learn about climate change. The game will be controlled by the keys on the Keyboard. The project has a tight deadline of 12/13/2024, and the team will work together to overcome the risks and constraints to deliver a high-quality product. The team is excited to work on this project and looks forward to presenting the final product on 12/19/2024.
