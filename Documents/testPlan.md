## II. Introduction

### 1. Overview

Our team was tasked with creating a serious game to raise awareness about ecology and climate change. Set in a post-apocalyptic world where humanity has abandoned a devastated Earth, players return centuries later to restore the planet. Through challenges like recycling, renewable energy use, and innovative solutions, players will learn about the consequences of environmental neglect and the steps needed to heal the planet. Our goal is to inspire players, especially young ones, to appreciate and protect our world, blending fun with impactful education.

### 2. Targeted audience

As testers, we need to put ourselves in the users' shoes. This means identifying all the different types of users who might interact with the product. By doing so, we can test the product from various perspectives, ensuring it meets the needs of all user types.

##### Former players
Former players are those already familiar with games focused on ecology or serious games in general. They’ll expect a polished experience that respects the genre's conventions while offering something new.

##### New players
New players may have little experience with serious games or ecology themes. They’ll need clear instructions and an intuitive layout to enjoy the game and understand its message about the environment.

##### Competitive players
Competitive players will be looking for challenges, such as achieving high scores or completing difficult tasks. They’ll expect replayable content, leaderboards, and rewarding challenges that test their skills.

## III. Testing

### 1. Scope

The main areas of focus for testing will be the documentation and the game itself.

For the documentation, it's essential to ensure clarity and accuracy so that everyone on the team has a consistent foundation and communicates effectively. Testing will involve checking for grammar, typos, and verifying that all content is complete and correctly reflects the project requirements.

For the game, we'll test each feature defined in the functional specifications to confirm it aligns with the initial design. This will include testing core gameplay mechanics, user interface elements, and environmental interactions. Additionally, we’ll test on multiple devices to ensure compatibility and performance consistency.


### 2. Strategy

Since the game is moderately complex, we’ll primarily conduct manual testing to cover specific features and interactions without excessive automation. We’ll start with smoke testing<sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup> to verify that basic game functions work properly. If the smoke test is successful, we’ll proceed with deeper functional tests, focusing on critical gameplay mechanics like resource management, recycling, and ecological actions.
