## II. Introduction

### 1. Overview

Our team has been assigned to develop a serious game with a focus on ecology and climate awareness. Players follow the story of Marie, a young woman who, after needing to repair a broken toaster, embarks on a journey of ecological discovery. Inspired by her small town's emphasis on sustainable living, she learns to recycle, compost, plant, and harness renewable energy. Through engaging activities and interactions, players will not only explore Marie’s story but will also gain practical insights into environmental preservation and sustainable habits that they can apply in real life. This game merges entertainment with ecological awareness, encouraging players of all ages to make positive changes for a healthier planet.

### 2. Targeted audience

As testers, we need to put ourselves in the users' shoes. This means identifying all the different types of users who might interact with the product. By doing so, we can test the product from various perspectives, ensuring it meets the needs of all user types.

##### Former players
Former players are familiar with serious games or eco-themed educational content. They’ll expect a seamless experience that respects the conventions of educational gaming while providing new insights into sustainability practices.

##### New players
New players may not have experience with educational games or ecology themes. They’ll need clear, accessible instructions and an intuitive layout to help them easily understand the game mechanics and its environmental message.

##### Competitive players
Competitive players will look for challenges within the game, such as achieving specific ecological goals or completing tasks efficiently. They’ll appreciate replayable content with rewarding challenges that encourage them to refine their skills in managing resources and making eco-friendly decisions.

## III. Testing

### 1. Scope

The main areas of focus for testing will be the documentation and the game itself.

For the documentation, it's essential to ensure clarity and accuracy so that everyone on the team has a consistent foundation and communicates effectively. Testing will involve checking for grammar, typos, and verifying that all content is complete and correctly reflects the project requirements.

For the game, we'll test each feature defined in the functional specifications to confirm it aligns with the initial design. This will include testing core gameplay mechanics, user interface elements, and environmental interactions. Additionally, we’ll test on multiple devices to ensure compatibility and performance consistency.


### 2. Strategy

Since the game is moderately complex, we’ll primarily conduct manual testing to cover specific features and interactions without excessive automation. We’ll start with smoke testing<sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup> to verify that basic game functions work properly. If the smoke test is successful, we’ll proceed with deeper functional tests, focusing on critical gameplay mechanics like resource management, recycling, and ecological actions.
