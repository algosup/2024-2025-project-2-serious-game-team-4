# 2024-2025 Project 2 - Serious Game Team 4

## Project Overview
This project is a serious game developed by Team 4 for the 2024-2025 academic year. Our game addresses climate change challenges through an interactive journey where the player must restore an uninhabitable Earth. To win the game, players will navigate and purify four distinct zones, each representing a unique environmental crisis.

The goal of the game is to raise awareness about climate issues and inspire players to think about solutions in a challenging and engaging way.

## Gameplay and Features
- **Four Zones:** Each zone is associated with a different environmental problem caused by human actions. Players must complete specific tasks in each zone to make Earth habitable again.
  - **Zone 1:** Extreme heat and radiation
  - **Zone 2:** Nuclear contamination
  - **Zone 3:** Oxygen depletion
  - **Zone 4:** Toxic waste
- **Safe Zone:** A central hub where players can recharge, craft items, and prepare for the next challenge.
- **Customizable Characters:** Players can choose from different characters with unique sprites.
- **Custom Assets:** We’ve created customized sprites, sounds, and music to give the game a distinctive feel.
- **Game Engine:** Developed in Godot for efficient 2D gameplay.
- **Art and Audio:** Characters and visuals are designed in Aseprite, and sound effects and music are created in FL Studio.
